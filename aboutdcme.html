              <p>
                The Department of Computer Science has been successfully spreading its branches since 1985.Computer Science Engineering (CSE) is an academic programme that integrates the field of Computer Engineering and Computer Science. It is one of the most sought-after courses among engineering students. The course contains a plethora of topics but emphasises the basics of computer programming and networking. The topics covered in the course are computation, algorithms, programming languages, program design, computer software, computer hardware and others. Computer science engineers are involved in many aspects of computing, from the design of individual microprocessors, personal computers, and supercomputers to circuit designing and writing software that powers them. Students pursuing these courses get to learn about the design, implementation and management of information systems of computer hardware and software.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Department is well-resourced with the modern computer labs and infrastructure. The well-equipped Air-conditioned Computer centres with 600 systems and latest configuration are meeting the needs of the contemporary intellects. The labs are connected to High-speed Internet to impart high-quality education to the students. As the Department of Computer Science deals with the design, application, and Management of Information System (MIS), to facilitate such learning, the programs are designed to offer students to work on various hardware and software platforms. The Department also organizes Seminars and Workshops to improve the technical skills of the students, so that they can face global competition. The Department of Computer Science also takes care of Software and Hardware requirements of the entire college.
              </p>
              <p>
                The strength of the Department of Computer Science is Undeniably the Alumni, who had pursued their Masters in various elite National and International Universities. A good number of students are being placed through campus placements in major IT, ITES, and core MNCs like Infosys, IBM, Tech Mahindra, Accenture, Cognizant and so on with good packages of more than 2 to 4 lakhs per annum. Global excellence and local relevance in research, teaching and technology development is the main motto of the department, to achieve this, the students are encouraged to carry out innovative research in their relevant fields and deliver quality services to match the needs of the technical edification, industry, and society.
